# POLUtils Style & Coding Guidelines

Main important Visual Studio setting: indentation: indent size 2, insert spaces.

An effort should be made to avoid placing TAB characters in sources, since they have a tendency
to make code appear different/ugly to different people, depending on editor/settings used.

A further solution-level settings file for ReSharper is provided as well, to make it easier to
follow other style conventions. If you have ReSharper installed, it should be used automatically.
